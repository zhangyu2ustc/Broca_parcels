. A highly overlapped connectivity map was generated for each subdivision of Broca's region, which also showed the disassociation of multiple networks that might be involved during language processing. For instance, the frontoparietal network (FPN), which is associated with working memory and attention, was functional correlated with area 44 and IFJ/IFS areas. The frontotemporal network, which is involved in speech andÂ auditory processing, was functional correlated with areas 45/47. In the meanwhile, area 6v was connected with the sensorimotor cortex, and op was associated with salience network.
