we identified functional five modules among the 13 subdivisions of Broca's region based on their group averaged connectivity matrix (Fig. 4). These five functional modules had distinguished connectivity fingerprints with the rest of brain (Fig. 5b), was associated with distinct functional roles (Fig. 5c), Â but still showed highly overlapped connectivity patterns among Chinese and German groups
