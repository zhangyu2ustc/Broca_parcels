Consistent functional parcellation of Broca's region consisting of 13 subdivisions was revealed among four different rs-fMRI dataset, with  high reproducibility both within and between groups. Additional analysis using the principle components of individual parcellation results and the distributions of the similarity indices across individuals (Fig. 1c), showed that there is no significant difference between Chinese and German groups. Our results showed that different language experiences did not affect the functional topology of Broca's region.
